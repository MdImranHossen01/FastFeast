    "details": "Cloud kitchens, also known as ghost kitchens, are delivery-only restaurants that operate without dine-in facilities. By eliminating the costs associated with a traditional restaurant setup, these kitchens can focus on improving food quality, optimizing delivery speed, and experimenting with new menu items. This model has become increasingly popular in Dhaka and other cities in Bangladesh, fueled by the growing demand for convenient, high-quality food delivered straight to your door. Many cloud kitchens partner with multiple delivery apps to reach a wider audience, making it easier than ever for customers to enjoy a variety of cuisines from the comfort of home. As this trend continues, cloud kitchens are reshaping the food delivery landscape in the country, offering both affordability and efficiency.",

    "excerpt": "How to make sure your food stays safe and hygienic during heavy rains.",
    "details": "The rainy season brings both relief and challenges for food delivery. Due to increased humidity and longer delivery times, maintaining food safety becomes more important than ever. To avoid any health risks, always order from trusted and well-reviewed restaurants that follow strict hygiene standards. Make sure the packaging is sealed properly to prevent water leakage or contamination during transit. It’s also wise to avoid items that spoil quickly in humid weather, such as seafood-based dishes, mayonnaise-heavy salads, or raw foods. Instead, opt for freshly cooked hot meals like rice bowls, noodles, or biriyani that stay safe for longer. Once delivered, consume the food within the recommended time rather than storing it for hours. By being a bit careful about where and what you order, you can enjoy your favorite meals safely even on rainy days!",

    "excerpt": "Tips and tricks to get discounts, promo codes, and free delivery offers.",
    "details": "Food delivery is convenient, but the costs can add up quickly if you order regularly. Fortunately, there are many simple strategies to save money without giving up the comfort of ordering from home. Start by always checking for promo codes before placing an order. Most apps offer daily or weekly discount codes that can take 10-30% off instantly. You can even subscribe to their newsletters or follow their social media pages to catch exclusive offers. Use multiple food delivery apps instead of sticking to just one. Prices and delivery fees vary from app to app, so comparing them before ordering can help you find the cheapest deal. Some apps also offer special discounts for first-time users, so take advantage of those using different accounts or devices. Make use of loyalty or reward programs. Apps like Foodpanda, Uber Eats, or DoorDash often give points for every order that can later be redeemed for free food or discounts. If you’re loyal to one platform, join their membership plan to unlock extra benefits like lower delivery fees. Order combo meals or group orders instead of single items. Combos often include a main dish, side, and drink at a much lower price compared to ordering separately. If you’re ordering with friends or family, place one large order instead of multiple small ones to save on delivery charges. Avoid peak-time delivery charges. Ordering slightly earlier or later than rush hours can help you skip surge pricing or extra delivery fees.With just a little planning, you can enjoy food delivery while keeping your expenses under control. The key is to compare prices, collect rewards, and use smart ordering strategies consistently.",

    "excerpt": "Quick, healthy, and affordable meals you can order online while working.",
    "details": "In fast-paced cities like Dhaka, busy professionals often end up skipping meals or relying on oily fast food due to lack of time. However, staying healthy doesn’t have to be difficult — it’s all about making smarter choices. Instead of ordering heavy biriyani or fried snacks every day, try switching to grilled chicken, brown rice bowls, or protein-packed wraps from online food platforms. Many restaurants now offer salad combos with eggs, chickpeas, or smoked chicken that keep you full without the extra calories. For homemade-style comfort food, cloud kitchens and tiffin services are a great option, offering dishes like khichuri, mashed vegetables, and fish curry — perfect for those who miss home-cooked meals. Another tip is to pair your main dish with fresh juices or sugar-free drinks instead of sodas. Planning your meals ahead or setting fixed 'healthy go-to orders' can reduce last-minute junk food temptations. Eating well is not about strict dieting — it’s about consistency and small upgrades. With just a few smart swaps, you can fuel your workday without compromising your health.",

    "details": "The rapid growth of internet access and affordable smartphones has made food delivery apps a natural part of daily urban life in Bangladesh. Busy professionals and students now prefer ordering food with just a few taps rather than cooking or dining out. On top of that, aggressive discounts, cashback offers, and loyalty rewards from platforms like Foodpanda, Pathao Food, and HungryNaki have made online delivery cheaper than traditional dining. The COVID-19 pandemic also played a major role by pushing people toward contactless services, turning delivery riders into essential workers overnight. Even after lockdowns were lifted, the habit of ordering food online stayed because of the unmatched convenience and time-saving benefits. Additionally, restaurants have started relying more on delivery platforms to increase their sales reach, and many home-based cloud kitchens have emerged solely to serve online customers. With growing trust in digital payments, faster delivery logistics, and expanding service areas beyond major cities, the online food delivery industry in Bangladesh is expected to grow even further in the coming years.",
